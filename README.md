# Decimal-To-Octal

Converting numbers decimal to octal

This program takes decimal numbers(between 1000-200000) from an input file(decimal.txt) as an argument and put them into any data structure,
then finds and displaystheir octal equivalents by using a stack (octal.txt), i.e convert the number with base value 10to base value 8.

I learned how stacks works and implementing a stack using linked list

Compile (javac *.java).
Run (java Main decimal.txt).
Output should be "octal.txt" .
